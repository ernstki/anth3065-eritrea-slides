UNHCR's 4R program (Repatriation, Reintegration, Rehabilitation and
Reconstruction)

Durable Solution?
-----------------

### Repatriation while cooperating with Eritrean gov't to address HR issues

UNHCR current challenge is to get Eritrea gov't to allow inspectors into
the country, while not beating them over the head with democritization
efforts
